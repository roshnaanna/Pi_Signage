## 🔧 Deployment & Quick Start

1. **Clone & Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amith-Abey-Stephen/Pi_Signage.git
   cd Pi_Signage
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/pi_signage
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   JWT_SECRET=your_32_character_secret
   # Optional Cloudinary Config
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
   ```

3. **Launch**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Kiosk Mode (Truly Automatic Fullscreen)**
   Pi Signage includes an automated launcher that opens the display in true full-screen mode instantly.

   **Standard Launch:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *This will start the server and automatically launch the browser in Fullscreen (Kiosk) mode after 5 seconds.*

   **Manual/Pi Autostart:**
   If you need to launch just the browser (e.g., in a Pi autostart script):
   ```bash
   npm run kiosk:pi
   ```

## 📖 Operational Guide

### 🖥️ First-Time Setup
Attach your Raspberry Pi to a monitor and power it on. The screen will automatically show a **Blue Setup Overlay** with an IP address. Visit that address on your laptop or phone to access the **Admin Console**.

### 🛠️ Managing Content
- **Add Media**: Upload files or click "Globe" to add a website URL.
- **Rotate**: Use the 🔄 button to fix orientation issues. Use **"Rotate All"** if you've flipped your monitor physically.
- **Push Update**: Once your playlist is ready, click **"Push to Display"** to trigger a real-time sync across all connected screens.
